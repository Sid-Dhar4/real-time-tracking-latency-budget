## MVP lock

First MVP only:

- KITTI tracking local split
- YOLOv8n pretrained detector
- ByteTrack tracker
- one or two KITTI sequences
- detections CSV
- tracks CSV
- latency CSV
- metrics CSV
- one threshold sweep
- one demo video/GIF
- failure analysis
- README and resume/interview polish

Not yet:

- ROS 2
- C++
- ONNX
- OC-SORT
- detector training
- multiple datasets
- public leaderboard submission

## Known risk

NVIDIA GPU is visible on PCI but nvidia-smi is not working. Current detector/tracker smoke tests use CPU. GPU benchmarking comes later.

## Rules

- Every runnable command block must have a START and END label.
- Every milestone must produce an evidence artifact.
- Every result must come from a script, saved CSV, log, plot, or generated report.
- Do not add fake metrics.
- Do not over-scope before the MVP works.
